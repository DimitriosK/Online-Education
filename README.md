# Online-Education

Online education services, such as Khan Academy and Coursera, provide a broader audience with
access to high-quality education. On these platforms, students can learn new materials by watching
a lecture, reading course material, and talking to instructors in a forum. However, one disadvantage
of the online platform is that it is challenging to measure studentsâ€™ understanding of the course
material. To deal with this issue, many online education platforms include an assessment component
to ensure that students understand the core topics. The assessment component is often composed
of diagnostic questions, each a multiple choice question with one correct answer. The diagnostic
question is designed so that each of the incorrect answers highlights a common misconception.
